**GUIDANCE abot how to use the code of our work**

The work is mainly made of two parts:
1. Modelling of SCL.
2. Modelling of primal-dual formulation.

We try to guide you to understand our logistics of coding, once you fully understand, then analyze any power systems you want.
- For the code of SCL modelling, please refer to the files named "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_", "_dataset_gene.jl_" and "_offline_trainning.jl_" in foler called "Model_SCL".

  "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_" calculates the IMPEDANCE of transmission lines of the system, easy to follow.

  "_dataset_gene.jl_" generates the data for classification, i.e., the offline trainning process mentioned in the second chapter of our paper. The subfunction "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_" is called here to obtain the transmissin line admittance matrix which is combined with the generators' admittance matrix (refer to line 76 in the code). Code from line 79-86 is the equation of actual, exact SCL representation. The remainder of code is generating all possible UC status pairs of generators. The matrix "I_SCC_all_buses_scenarios" are the SCL corresponding to "matrix_Ï‰" (storing UC status and capacity factor of IBR, comprising all possible scenarios).

  "_offline_trainning.jl_" is the trainning process, with inputting parameters from above subfunctions.

- For the code of primal-dual modelling, i.e., the final bi-level model running, as we have several scenarios, here we only publich lodal strategic bidding in Bus 2 and distant strategic bidding in Bus 27 and Bus 4. Other cases are easy to be simulated by following a similar coding structure. As for the pricing of SCL service by the single-level formulation, please do it by readers yourselves, however we still give the offer we used in the paper (the file named "AS_offer_price.mat"). 

- In the practical simulation, please put all files in one folder, e.g., "_bi_level_SCL_Local_Bus2.jl_", "_bi_level_SCL_distant.jl_", "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_", "_dataset_gene.jl_", "_offline_trainning.jl_" and "_Linespara_". Then run the main file "_bi_level_SCL_Local_Bus2.jl_" or "_bi_level_SCL_distant.jl_".

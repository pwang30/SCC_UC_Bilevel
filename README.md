**GUIDANCE abot how to use the code of our work**

The work is mainly made of two parts:
1. Modelling of SCC.
2. Modelling of primal-dual formulation.

We try to guide you to understand our logistics of coding, once you fully understand, then analyze any power systems you want.
- For the code of SCC modelling, please refer to the files named "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_", "_dataset_gene.jl_" and "_offline_trainning.jl_" in foler called "Model_SCL".

  1. "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_" calculates the impedance of transmission lines of the system, easy to follow.

  2. "_dataset_gene.jl_" generates the data for classification, i.e., the offline trainning process mentioned in the second chapter of our paper. The subfunction "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_" is called here to obtain the transmissin line admittance matrix which is combined with the generators' admittance matrix (refer to line 76 in "_dataset_gene.jl_", from line 79-86, it is the equation of actual, exact SCC representation). The remainder of code is generating all possible UC status pairs of generators. The matrix "I_SCC_all_buses_scenarios" are the SCC corresponding to "matrix_Ï‰" (storing UC status and capacity factor of IBR, comprising all possible scenarios).

  3. "_offline_trainning.jl_" is the trainning process, with inputting parameters from above subfunctions.

- For the code of primal-dual modelling, i.e., the final bi-level model running, please refer to the files named "_bi_level_SCL_Local_Bus2.jl_", "_bi_level_SCL_distant.jl_" in foler called "Strategic_bidding".

  1. As we have numerous scenarios, here we only publish the case where two strategic generators located in bus 2 and the case where three strategic generators located in bus 2 and bus 27. Other cases are easy to be simulated by following a similar coding structure.
  2. As for the pricing of SCC service by the single-level formulation, please do it by readers yourselves, however we still give the marginal bid we used in the paper (the file named "AS_offer_price.mat"). 

- In the practical simulation, please put all files in one folder, e.g., "_bi_level_SCL_Local_Bus2.jl_", "_bi_level_SCL_distant.jl_", "_admittance_matrix_calculation.jl_", "_dataset_gene.jl_", "_offline_trainning.jl_", "Linespara" and "AS_offer_price.mat". Then run the main file "_bi_level_SCL_Local_Bus2.jl_" or "_bi_level_SCL_distant.jl_".

**NOTE the linearized SCC constraints are given in "_Linearized_SCL_equation.jl_".**
